# STGS — Development Roadmap

**Scientific Travel Grant System — ФИНКИ / UKIM**

---

## 1. Product Summary

STGS digitizes the full lifecycle of scientific travel grants at ФИНКИ: application submission → multi-level approval → advance payment → expense report submission → settlement. It replaces the current paper/email/Excel process.

**Target:** First operational version within one academic semester.

---

## 2. Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript) | SSR for forms and PDFs; file-based routing maps cleanly to roles |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS | Accessible, customizable; quick to build role-specific dashboards |
| i18n | next-intl | Macedonian (Cyrillic) + English; RTL-safe |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) | Already provisioned; handles auth, file storage, RLS |
| Auth | Supabase Auth + iKnow OIDC/SAML provider | SSO via existing ФИНКИ identity service |
| File Storage | Supabase Storage | Documents (PDF/DOCX) and receipts (PDF/JPG/PNG) |
| OCR | Google Cloud Vision API (via Edge Function) | Best accuracy for scanned receipts in Cyrillic |
| Email | ФИНКИ SMTP relay (via Edge Function) | Required by SRS; notifications on status changes |
| Digital Signature | Supabase Edge Function → external MAdNS/UKIM PKI endpoint | Macedonia-recognized certificates |
| PDF Generation | react-pdf (server-side) | Decisions, archive documents |

---

## 5. Development Phases

### Phase 0 — Foundation (Week 1–2)
**Goal:** Deployable skeleton with auth, schema, and role-based navigation.

- [ ] Initialize Next.js 14 project (TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- [ ] Configure next-intl for Macedonian + English
- [ ] Apply full Supabase schema (migrations)
- [ ] Configure Supabase Auth with iKnow OIDC provider
- [ ] Build profile sync: on first login, upsert `profiles` from iKnow claims
- [ ] Role-based route guard middleware
- [ ] Seed: budget rows for current year, test users for each role
- [ ] CI/CD: GitHub Actions → Vercel (or ФИНКИ server) preview deploys

**Deliverable:** Any iKnow user can log in, lands on a role-appropriate dashboard shell.

---

### Phase 1 — Application Submission (Week 3–4)
**Goal:** Applicant can submit a complete grant application. (UC-01)

- [ ] Application form: conference details, dates, amounts, purpose
- [ ] Auto-populate first_name / last_name / department / email from profile (R-14)
- [ ] Document upload component: drag-and-drop, type selector, size/format validation (R-01, R-15)
- [ ] Application checklist validation before submission
- [ ] Status transition: draft → submitted
- [ ] Applicant's "My Applications" list with status badges
- [ ] In-app notification + email on submission confirmation (R-05)

**Deliverable:** Applicant can submit an application end-to-end; Supabase Storage holds documents.

---

### Phase 2 — Review & Approval (Week 5–6)
**Goal:** Scientific Council and Deanery can review and decide. (UC-02)

- [ ] Scientific Council queue: list of submitted applications with filters
- [ ] Application detail view: documents viewer, budget context, requester profile
- [ ] Decision form: Approve / Partially Approve (amount field + justification) / Reject (R-03)
- [ ] Digital signature integration (R-04): call `sign-decision` Edge Function on submit
- [ ] Status flow: submitted → under_review_council → under_review_deanery → approved/partially_approved/rejected
- [ ] Trigger: `update_budget_on_approval` on Deanery decision (R-06)
- [ ] Email notification to applicant on each decision (R-05)
- [ ] Deanery decision auto-generates `advances` row (status: pending)

**Deliverable:** Full multi-step approval flow with digital signature and budget deduction.

---

### Phase 3 — Advance Payment (Week 7) ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Accounting processes advance payment. (UC-03)

- [x] Accounting dashboard: list of applications grouped by status (approved / for_payment / paid)
- [x] "Issue advance" action: creates advances row, status → for_payment
- [x] "Confirm payment" action: enters payment_reference + date, status → paid; mock MAdNS R-07
- [x] Digital signature simulation by Accounting on confirmation
- [ ] Budget overview widget (Deanery): allocated vs. paid vs. remaining per department/year (R-06)

**Deliverable:** Payment status lifecycle complete; applicant sees real-time status updates.

---

### Phase 4 — Expense Report & OCR (Week 8–9) 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Applicant submits final report; receipts are OCR-processed. (UC-04)

- [x] Expense report form (available only after status = paid) — `/applicant/applications/[id]/report/new`
- [x] Receipt upload: drag-and-drop, PDF/JPG/PNG, 10 MB limit, category + manual amount entry
- [x] `process-ocr` simulation: `/api/ocr-simulate` returns amount/currency/date/category + per-field confidence
- [x] SHA-256 content hash duplicate detection: client-side via `crypto.subtle.digest`; `is_duplicate_suspect` flag
- [x] OCR confidence breakdown UI: per-field bars (green/yellow/red), overall score, manual override
- [x] `src/lib/ocr-validation.ts`: cross-field validation (amount range, date in travel window, known currency)
- [x] Proof of attendance upload (`proof-of-attendance` bucket)
- [x] Status transition: paid → report_submitted on submit
- [ ] Status transition: report_submitted → in_settlement (Phase 5 trigger)
- [ ] Trigger: `auto_create_settlement` with initial calculation (Phase 5)

**Deliverable:** Applicant can submit receipts; OCR extracts data automatically with manual override.

---

### Phase 5 — Settlement & Archive (Week 10–11)
**Goal:** Accounting reviews and finalizes settlement; application archived. (UC-05)

- [ ] Accounting settlement view: advance amount vs. claimed amount, breakdown by receipt
- [ ] Duplicate suspect queue: Accounting manually verifies flagged receipts (R-10)
- [ ] Settlement decision: confirm amounts, mark direction (refund / return / balanced)
- [ ] Refund flow: if ФИНКИ owes → generate supplementary payment order
- [ ] Return flow: if applicant owes → display bank transfer instructions; applicant uploads proof
- [ ] On proof confirmed: status → closed; archive_number assigned (R-17)
- [ ] Edge Function `generate-archive-pdf`: signed decision bundle uploaded to `signed-decisions`
- [ ] Archive role: read-only search by archive_number, applicant, year

**Deliverable:** Full settlement lifecycle; every closed application has a signed, archived PDF bundle.

---

### Phase 6 — Reporting & Notifications (Week 12)
**Goal:** Budget dashboards, smart reminders, complete notification coverage. (UC-06)

- [ ] Applicant budget widget: approved / paid / claimed / remaining (R-12)
- [ ] Deanery budget report: table + chart by department/year; CSV + PDF export (UC-06)
- [ ] Edge Function `deadline-reminder-cron`: daily check; insert reminders 7 days and 1 day before `report_deadline` (R-13)
- [ ] HR role: read-only view of decisions for their employees
- [ ] Notification center: in-app list, mark-as-read, link to application (R-05)
- [ ] Email template polish: Macedonian + English variants (R-16)

**Deliverable:** Full observability for all roles; no status change goes unnotified.

---

### Phase 7 — Hardening & Launch (Week 13–14)
**Goal:** Production-ready, secure, and performance-validated system.

- [ ] RLS audit: verify every table policy; no role can read/write beyond their scope (NFR-01, NFR-02)
- [ ] Session expiry: enforce 30-minute inactivity timeout (NFR-01)
- [ ] GDPR / LZDP compliance check: data minimization, right-to-erasure plan
- [ ] End-to-end test suite: Playwright covering all 6 use cases
- [ ] Performance: application list page < 2s under 50 concurrent users
- [ ] Uptime target: 99.0% in ФИНКИ working hours (NFR-03)
- [ ] 10-minute onboarding test with a real applicant (NFR-04)
- [ ] iKnow production credentials + SMTP production relay
- [ ] MAdNS production certificate configuration
- [ ] User acceptance testing with stakeholders (each role)
- [ ] Soft launch: parallel operation with old process for 4 weeks

## 6. MoSCoW Priority Summary

| Priority | Requirements | Phases |
|---|---|---|
| **Must Have** | R-01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,11,17,18 | 0–5, 7 |
| **Should Have** | R-09,10,12,13,14 | 1, 4, 6 |
| **Could Have** | R-15,16 | 1, 6 |
| **Won't Have (v1)** | Flight/hotel booking, non-travel grants | — |

---

## 7. Key Constraints (from SRS)

- Deanery must remain a **human** final approver — no automated approval path may bypass it.
- Digital signatures must use **UKIM/MAdNS certificates** accepted by Macedonian institutions.
- Mandatory **Macedonian (Cyrillic)** interface support.
- Physical originals of certain documents must still be submitted to Accounting — the system tracks this but does not replace it.
- Annual travel budget ≈ **100,000 MKD**; system overhead must not reduce it.
- First operational version due: **end of one academic semester** from project start.
